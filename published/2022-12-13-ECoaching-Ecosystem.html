<main>
  <p>I just finished reading the following paper:</p>
  <pre><code>  &quot;An e-coaching ecosystem: design and effectiveness analysis of the engagement of remote coaching on athletes.&quot;
Boratto, L., Carta, S., Mulas, F. et al. Pers Ubiquit Comput 21, 689–704 (2017).  
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-017-1026-0</code></pre>
  <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
  <p>Upon finding this paper I was super excited, because it is directly
  related to my existing project on remote coaching of athletes by human
  coaches. This paper examines the usefulness in behavior change of an
  existing application for remotely coaching runners. The app allows
  users to be linked with a human coach who programs their training
  program and analyzes their performance. One interesting aspect of this
  app is the coach can also setup a virtual trainer that can communicate
  with the athlete while they workout. The virtual trainer can read
  notes or give feedback or give encouragement to the athlete. The users
  can also opt to create their own workouts as well including using the
  virtual trainer.</p>
  <div style="background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 10pt;">
  <p>One important point that I will discuss further below is that in
  order to utilize the human coach users had to subscribe to the
  coaching service.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The authors conduct a study on the apps user data to gain insight
  into the following research questions:</p>
  <p><strong>RQ1:</strong> Are the human-coach created workouts
  preferred by athletes? If so, to what extent?</p>
  <p><strong>RQ2:</strong> Do athletes train more often when under the
  supervision of a human coach?</p>
  <p><strong>RQ3:</strong> Do athletes complete more human-coach
  programmed workouts or more athlete-programmed workouts?</p>
  <p>They answer these questions using quantitative methods.</p>
  <p>The results of their analysis is summarized as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>RQ1:</strong> Users prefer human-coach programmed
  workouts:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>“75% of athletes performed 54% or more of their workouts by
  completing those assigned by a human coach” [p. 698].</p></li>
  <li><p>“50% of athletes performed 94% or more of their workouts by
  completing those assigned by a human coach” [p. 698].</p></li>
  <li><p>“25% of the athletes performed athlete-programmed workouts”
  [p. 698].</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>RQ2:</strong> Yes, users train more when they are supported
  by a human coach. The authors state: “The human-coach is fundamental
  to keep users motivated.” [p. 700]</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>“25% of the athletes only worked out during their subscription
  period” [p. 700].</p></li>
  <li><p>“50% of the athletes were most active during their
  subscriptions period which consisted of 78 to 100% of their active
  training weeks” [p. 700].</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>RQ3:</strong> Yes, athletes complete more workouts when
  they are programmed by a human coach.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>“56% of the athletes completed their workout sessions when
  using a human coach.” [p. 701]</p></li>
  <li><p>“12% of the athletes completed athlete-programmed workouts.”
  [p. 701]</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="study-critique">Study Critique</h3>
  <p>These are very nice results, but I have a hard time putting a lot
  of faith in them even though I want to, because they support my
  intuition. However, there are two main issues I have with this
  study:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li><p><strong>Paid Subscriptions:</strong> The paper does not discuss
  the impact a paid subscription model has on the results of the
  study.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Ethics:</strong> The paper does not discuss the means
  to which the authors gained access to the data for the study. Nor does
  the paper discuss participant consent.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The subscription model has an affect on participant engagement. The
  very act of being willing to financially invest in coaching implies a
  higher level of engagement by the athlete. This could support the high
  engagement of subscribers versus the low engagement of
  non-subscribers. It is my opinion that a better study would follow a
  free model to remove this potential bias.</p>
  <p>The main ethical issues I have with this study is there is no
  discussion of participant consent. The study was conducted on the data
  of real paid subscribers of the mobile app <em>u4fit</em>. Since the
  participants are actual paid subscribers did they know that their data
  was being used as part of a research study? Did they have an option to
  opt out of the study? Unfortunately, none of this was discussed in the
  paper.</p>
