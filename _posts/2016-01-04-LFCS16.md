The Symposium on the Logical Foundations of Computer Science is underway.  I am lucky enough to have given a talk.  I presented my work with <a href="">Valeria de Paiva</a> on full intuitionistic linear logic and its categorical models.  The paper can be found <a href="http://metatheorem.org/includes/pubs/LFCS16.pdf">here</a>, and my slides can be found <a href="http://metatheorem.org/includes/talks/2016-LFCS16.pdf">here</a>.  The workshop is being held at the beautiful <a href="http://www.wyndham.com/">Wyndham Hotel and Resort</a> which is quite literally on the beach.  As you exit the hotel you see nothing but a beautiful ocean view:

However, the con of this venue is that it's expensive, and so I decided to stay at the less amazing Hampton Inn, and commute over in the morning.  So far so good.  For more information on the symposium check out the <a href="http://lfcs.info/lfcs-2016/">webpage</a>.

My talk went quite well, and I am happy that I was not as nervous as I usually am; I think perhaps lecturing regularly has helped with my nerves.  After the talk I got a number of good questions which is great.  I always get nervous about not getting any.  

One question was quite interesting which was "why hasn't anyone done the cut-elimination and categorical models for non-commutative (full) intuitionistic logic?"  I don't know the answer to this question, but perhaps it would be interesting to write it down.

I might post more later.
