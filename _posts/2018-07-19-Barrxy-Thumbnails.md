This post is mostly for me when I am doing proofs.  But, here is a PDF that contains only the thumbnails page from [Barr's diagrams package](http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/macros/generic/diagrams/diagxy/diaxydoc.pdf).  I am always going there and scrolling down to page 40.  Now I will visit here instead.  So I decided to just convert just that page to a PDF, and I thought others might want it as well.

Find it [here](/includes/barrxy-thumbnails.pdf).

Happy CTing!
