This year I'm the faculty chair of the School of Computer and Cyber
Sciences' Colloquium Series.  As many of you, I've had to transition
this course online.  Thus, when choosing the final speaker of the
semester I did not take distance into consideration, because the
requirement to physically come to Augusta University and present is no
longer required.  In addition, since there is no need for financial
support, I'm also more free in who I ask to present.

So I am happy to announce that [Paul-André
Melliès](https://www.irif.fr/~mellies/) will be our final presenter
of the semester, but that's not all!  I have 100 seats available on my
Zoom account, and only 30 of them will be needed for AU students and
faculty.  That leaves open 70 seats!  So I am taking RSVPs from anyone
who would like to attend the talk online.

The presentation information is as follows:

- **When:** April 24th at 2pm EDT / 8pm CEST
- **RSVP:** April 20th by email ([harley.eades@gmail.com](mailto:harley.eades@gmail.com))
- **Who:** [Paul-André Melliès](https://www.irif.fr/~mellies/) (CNRS, University of Paris)
- **Title:** "A gentle introduction to template games"
- **Abstract:**

  Game semantics is the art of interpreting formulas (or types) as
  games and proofs (or programs) as strategies. In order to reflect
  the interactive behaviour of programs, strategies are required to
  follow specific scheduling policies. Typically, in the case of a
  sequential programming language, the program (Player) and its
  environment (Opponent) play one after the other, in a strictly
  alternating way. On the other hand, in the case of a concurrent
  language, Player and Opponent are allowed to play several moves in a
  row, in a non alternating way. In the two cases, the scheduling
  policy is designed very carefully in order to ensure that the
  strategies synchronise properly and compose well when plugged
  together. A longstanding conceptual problem has been to understand
  when and why a given scheduling policy works and is compositional in
  that sense. In this talk, I will introduce the notion of template
  game and exhibit a number of simple and fundamental combinatorial
  properties which ensure that a given scheduling policy defines
  (indeed) a monoidal closed bicategory of games, strategies and
  simulations. The notion of template game will be illustrated by
  constructing two game models of linear logic with different flavours
  (alternating and non alternating) using the same categorical
  combinatorics, performed in the category of small 2-categories.

- **Bio:**

  Paul-André Melliès is a CNRS Researcher in France, and works in the
  Computer Science Department of the University of Paris. He also
  teaches at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris a graduate course on
  the connection between lambda-calculus, functional languages and
  category theory.

  Paul-André Melliès has worked on a number of areas of logic,
  computer science and mathematics, including lambda-calculus,
  rewriting theory, algebraic and monadic effects in functional
  languages, semantics of low level languages, formal certification of
  machine code, game semantics, linear logic, concurrent separation
  logic, higher-order automata, higher categories, axiomatic homotopy
  theory. Behind this apparent diversity, he is looking for common
  unifying patterns, and for a simple description of the linguistic,
  geometric and interactive structures at work in logic and
  mathematics.
