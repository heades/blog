The ForML -- formal methods and computational logic -- [Lab at Augusta University](https://the-au-forml-lab.github.io/index.html) is looking for a postdoc.  The start date, length of term, and salary are all negotiable, but the latter will be competitive with respect to US based postdoc salaries.

We are looking for those who are interested in working with myself and/or Dr. Clement Aubert.  My current project is called the [Granule Project](https://granule-project.github.io/) whose goal is to study the theory and application of graded modalities to type-based programming languages, formal verification, and logic.  [Dr. Aubert's project](http://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/) is on the semantics and applications concurrency in programming languages.

I will be attending [ICFP 2019](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/) this year, and if anyone who is also attending or who is near Berlin would like to chat about this opportunity, then please do not hesitate to contact me.

The official ad is below, but please send informal inquires to me directly.  When officially applying please indicate in your statement of purpose that you are interested in working with the ForML Lab.

Very best,
Harley Eades
Clement Aubert

The formal methods group is led by Paul Attie, Clement Aubert, Harley Eades, and Alexander Schwarzmann.  We are interested in state of the art theory and its application.  Among our envisaged directions is the application of formal methods to cybersecurity and sophisticated distributed systems (both hardware and software).  PhD students who expect to graduate within a year are encouraged to apply.

The formal methods group is located in the Georgia Cyber Center (https://www.gacybercenter.org/) a $100 M facility which is ``the single largest investment in a cybersecurity facility by a state government to date.''  The Georgia Cyber Center seeks to prove the USA with a ``decisive advantage in cyberspace,'' by means of a unique industry-government-academia partnership.  The Georgia Cyber Center hosts companies involved in cybersecurity work, and together with the US Army Cyber Command headquartered in Fort Gordon, Augusta, (https://www.arcyber.army.mil/) and local academia, provides a unique ecosystem where challenge problems from military and industry feed into academic research, and research results feed back into industry and government practice.
