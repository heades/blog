I've been asked a few times now for the history behind graded
modalities (graded monads and graded comonads). So I decided to just
type up the history real fast so I can easily send it to others. I'll
break this down into a chronological list of papers for graded monads
(graded effects) and graded comonads (graded coeffects or graded
resource tracking).  This is not a complete bibliography, but a list
of papers that could be considered milestone papers.

Additions and clarifications welcome!
