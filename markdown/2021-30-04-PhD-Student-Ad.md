My recent NSF proposal called "Semantically and Practically
Generalizing Graded Modal Types" was
[funded](https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_windowLabel=rsrViewAllAwards_1_2&wsrp-urlType=blockingAction&wsrp-url=&wsrp-requiresRewrite=&wsrp-navigationalState=eJyLL07OL0i1Tc-JT0rMUYNQtgBZ6Af8&wsrp-interactionState=wlprsrViewAllAwards_1_2_action%3DviewRsrDetail%26wlprsrViewAllAwards_1_2_fedAwrdId%3D2104535&wsrp-mode=wsrp%3Aview&wsrp-windowState=).
This award has funds for my first ever PhD student!  I couldn't have
gotten this award sooner, because our [PhD
program](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/phd-ccs.php) goes live this Fall
2021.

Therefore, I am actively recruiting a PhD student to begin as early as
Fall 2021 (August 01, 2021)!  Checkout the ad below, and let me know
if anyone has questions.

There is a lot of interesting work to be done in the following non-exhaustive list of topic areas:

- category theory
- type theory
- modal logic and types
- graded types
- substructural logics
- design and implementation of functional programming languages

## PhD Student Ad

Harley Eades of the Granule Project and Augusta University's ForML Lab
is actively seeking applications for a PhD student starting Fall 2021.
The successful applicant will be funded--including tuition, salary,
and (international) conference travel--for the first three years of
their appointment through a new NSF funded project:

"Semantically and Practically Generalizing Graded Modal Types"

A short overview of the main goals of this project is as follows:

"We propose to investigate the theory and practice of graded modal
types with the goal of combining and generalizing type-based software
verification and data-usage tracking, thereby extending the
verification abilities of type systems. To carry out this research we
plan to:

1. investigate a new foundational theory for graded modal types based
   on the underlying theory of constructive modal logics that will
   support several new kinds of data-usage tracking making them more
   applicable to real-world problems.

2. design and implement Tenli; a general purpose functional
   programming language with graded modal types that supports general
   type-based software verification;

3. design new pedagogical materials for teaching resourceful software
   verification at both the undergraduate and graduate levels using
   Tenli, and other tools."

The successful applicant will be advised by Harley Eades, but also
collaborate with Dominic Orchard and his students in the Granule
Project.  In addition, they will have the opportunity to help mentor
summer undergraduate research assistants through new collaborations
with:

- Clark Atlanta: A historically black university, and
- Wesleyan College: An all womens school in Georgia.

This is also an exciting time to join the ever growing Augusta
University who has made Computer Science one of the main pillars of
their university.  We have successfully recruited ten new faculty (at
all ranks) per year for the last three years.  Fall 2021 marks the
[inaugural year of our PhD
program](https://jagwire.augusta.edu/school-of-computer-and-cyber-sciences-to-offer-new-phd-program/)
and the successful applicant will be among the first PhD students in
Computer
Science at our university.  

Even though this is the inaugural year of our PhD program Harley Eades
has mentored and collaborated with several PhD students over the
course of the last six years.  As part of a different NSF funded
project Harley Eades recruited and collaborated with three PhD
students from other universities through stipends.  In addition, he
actively collaborates with and has helped mentor PhD students working
with Dominic Orchard.  Finally, Harley Eades is an active SIGPLAN
Mentor (<https://www.sigplan.org/LongTermMentoring/>) of one PhD
student.

Interested students should meet the following properties:

- Be interested in the overall project as stated above. 

- Have or are about to complete a Bachelor of Science in Computer
  Science or a related field (Computer Engineering, Information
  Systems, Software Engineering, Mathematics, etc.).

- Have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale.

- Both national and International applicants are welcome.

If you are interested in applying for this opportunity please begin by
contacting Harley Eades (<harley.eades@gmail.com>) with the following
information:

- A brief introduction of yourself and if you've done any research
  already.

- CV/Resume
