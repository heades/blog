One area of HCI I'm getting most excited about is visualization 
research, because of my interest in the design of fitness/training
applications for remote athletes.  When I started thinking about this
area one question I had right away is what visualizations are best?
That is, which are most accessible, quick to read, and convey the most
information in the least space?

In fitness and habit tacking, the most popular visualizations I have
found are bar charts and radials.  So one question that I immediately
had was how good are these two visualizations? That is, which conveys
quick information, can support a large number of data values, and is
most accessible? There is a rather recent paper that answers the first
question:

T. Blascheck, L. Besan√ßon, A. Bezerianos, B. Lee and P. Isenberg, "Glanceable Visualization: Studies of Data Comparison Performance on Smartwatches," in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 630-640, Jan. 2019, doi: 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865142.

An image of a three-by-three gird of several styles of charts (without
labels) in various colors. There are three styles of charts given:
bar, donut, and radial.  Each chart is presented with three data
values of seven, twelve, and twenty four. Bars within each chart that
are the simulus in the study are marked with a black dot.  Finally, an
example chart on a smartwatch is depicted to the right of the
grid. This image is from p. 2 of [Blascheck et. al

This paper is great, and reading it got me super fired up!  So
naturally, I wanted to write up a quick post on it.  They describe
their study in full detail, provide their own critiques, and propose
and hint at a lot of open questions. All the markings of a great
paper!

## Overview

The main research question of the paper is:

**RQ**: Which chart type offers the best speed when comparing multiple
data values on the screen of a standard smartwatch?

The chart types, bar, donut, and radial, were chosen based on an
analysis of the top most popular activity tracking apps on the Android
store.  Their analysis also found that the number of data values
visualized in the various charts in the most popular apps were seven,
twelve, and twenty four. 

They then designed a multi-phase study to answer RQ.

## Study

One of the things I loved about this paper was the thoroughness of 
their explanation of their study especially in its design, results,
and critiques.  As a budding HCI researcher and practitioner

Their study had three main phases:

1. Pre-study
2. Main study
3. Follow-up study
