  Last week I attended
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/">LL2016</a> in Lyon, France.
  It was four days long and consisted of a short
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/1">fall
  school</a> during the first two days, and to workshops during the
  remainder of the week. The workshops were
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/3">Linear
  logic and philosophy</a> and
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/4">Linear
  logic, mathematics and computer science</a>.

  </center>
  <p>One very cool aspect of this event was that its topic is Linear
  Logic and it took place in Lyon. Linear Logic was invented by
  Jean-Yves Girard in 1986 who was born in Lyon. So the location of the
  event was prefect. The event was also well attended. The
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/resource/listeparticipants">participant
  list</a> contains 106 entries, and during the Linear logic,
  mathematics, and computer science workshop I did a quick count of 90
  people in the room.</p>
  <p>Since I was going all the way to France I thought why not make the
  best of it, and so decided to attend the fall school. It was very well
  put together. The lectures assumed zero knowledge of linear logic, and
  began with a very nice introduction by
  <a href="http://www-philo.univ-paris1.fr/Joinet/NEW/index.php">Jean-Baptiste
  Joinet</a>, and was followed up by
  <a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/olivier.laurent/">Olivier
  Laurent</a>
  (<a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/conference/ll2016/olivier.pdf">slides</a>)
  who discussed multiplicative-additive linear logic (MALL). I was
  particularly excited about Olivier’s lecture, because he introduced
  the concept of proof nets.</p>
  <p>One interesting thing to note is that the school concentrated on
  classical logic instead of other flavors such as intuitionistic logic.
  In addition, the school presented the logic in a single sided
  formulation. That is, instead of a sequent like <span
  class="math display">\[A_1,\ldots,A_i \vdash B_1,\ldots,B_j\]</span>
  they used a sequent like <span class="math display">\[\vdash \lnot
  A_1,\ldots,\lnot A_i,B_1,\ldots,B_j\]</span>. In classical logic they
  are equiprovable. I am very grateful they did this, because it gave me
  a chance to think about this formalization, and decided what I thought
  about it. I have realized that for MALL it works quite well, but when
  we add more structure, like the modalities, it can be confusing, and
  hard to understand.</p>
  This brings us to
  <a href="http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mazza/">Damiano Mazza’s</a>
  lecture “Exponentials Attack!”
  (<a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/conference/ll2016/damiano.pdf">slides</a>).
  Since we are in a single-sided formalization of classical linear logic
  he introduces the why-not exponential – or as I like to call the
  modality, because exponential conflicts with the terms use in category
  theory. This modality is denoted <span
  class="math display">\[?A\]</span>. The sequent calculus rules for
  this connective are as follows:
  <center>
  <a href="/images/posts/2016-11-12-LL2016/why-not.jpeg"><img width="80%" src="/images/posts/2016-11-12-LL2016/why-not.jpeg"></a>
  </center>
  <p>The point of this modality is to give us the left two rules which
  are the structural rules for weakening and contraction. The third rule
  is called promotion, and allows us to inject any formula into the
  modality, finally, the fourth rule is called dereliction, but this one
  looks funny. What is this <span class="math display">\[!A\]</span>? In
  classical logic every connective has a dual connective and as it turns
  out <span class="math display">\[\lnot ?A = !\lnot A\]</span>.
  However, as one student at the school asked, what does it mean? The
  lecturer simply said, well, its dual to why-not, and this rule relates
  them.</p>
  This is where the single-sided formalization of linear logic can be
  confusing. Since <span class="math display">\[!A\]</span> is dual to
  <span class="math display">\[?A\]</span> the former should also model
  some structural rules, but the single sided version does not make this
  explicit. However, the two sided version does. Consider the following
  rules for the linear modalities in two-sided fashion:
  <center>
  <a href="/images/posts/2016-11-12-LL2016/two-sided-modalities.jpeg"><img width="80%" src="/images/posts/2016-11-12-LL2016/two-sided-modalities.jpeg"></a>
  </center>
  <p>As the rules show, <span class="math display">\[!A\]</span> gives
  us the structural rules on the left, and <span
  class="math display">\[?A\]</span> gives us the structural rules on
  the right. Categorically, <span class="math display">\[!A\]</span> is
  a comonad and <span class="math display">\[?A\]</span> is a monad, in
  fact, the promotion rules are the units of these structures. I think
  that the lecture on modalities could have simply flashed these to the
  audience and it would have helped. Using these modalities we can now
  encode non-linear classical logic in linear logic.</p>
  <p>The final lecture of the school was by
  <a href="http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~vaux/">Lionel Vaux</a> on
  denotational semantics
  (<a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/conference/ll2016/lionel.pdf">slides</a>).
  It was very good! I really enjoyed learning about the relational
  models and the coherence spaces. It was nice to see the semantics
  related to the proof nets.</p>
  <p>The school was quite good, and I liked how consistent everyone was
  with the content. All the lecturers used the same syntax and knew
  exactly what the others were going to teach. This made everything a
  lot easier to follow. I liked a lot the notion of having a school just
  before a series of conferences or workshops, because it can help
  prepare new graduate students to better understand the basics before
  being hit with the conference talks.</p>
  Directly following the school was the workshop
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/3">Linear
  logic and philosophy</a>. The coolest part of this workshop was that
  Girard was an invited speaker! Yes, I saw Girard. It was really cool.
  I am not a philosopher, and so I really cannot comment much on this
  workshop. Admittedly, I did not stay for the entire workshop, and used
  the time to take in Lyon. Checkout the photos at the end of this page
  for some things I saw.

  <a href="http://metatheorem.org/includes/talks/LL2016/talk/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" width="50%" src="/images/posts/2016-11-12-LL2016/LL2016-talk-title-page.png"></a>
  </center>
  <p>Following the philosophy workshop there was the workshop on
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/4">Linear
  logic, mathematics and computer science</a>. This was the whole reason
  I went, and I was very much looking forward to going. I am new to the
  linear logic community, and so I was looking forward to getting a
  chance to connect and meet new people. The workshop did not
  disappoint!</p>
  <p>During the first day I gave a talk called “On Linear Modalities for
  Exchange, Weakening, and Contraction”; click the image to the left to
  see the slides. This talk is related to my
  <a href="https://github.com/MonoidalAttackTrees">attack trees
  project</a>, and it seemed to be well received. I got some good
  feedback, and a number of people told me they liked my talk. So that’s
  good. I was very nervous, because there were some big names in the
  crowed. I also thought that this talk, being about the structural
  rules to model various computational structures like processes would
  be kind of an outlier, but how wrong I was. The topic of my talk fit
  in quite well with other talks, and even suggested new connections. So
  I take this talk as a success.</p>
  <p>There were two recurring topics of this workshop: graphical models
  of substructural logics like variations of proofs nets, and the
  concept of graded or bounded linear logic. However, there were two
  talks on non-commutative linear logic, mine and one on connections to
  linguistics. There were a few others as well.</p>
  Graded/bounded linear logic is quite new, and I think will have
  connections to my project as well.
  <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dao7/">Dominic
  Orchard</a> gave a great talk on this. The idea is to replace the
  usual linear modality <span class="math display">\[!A\]</span> – here
  we will be in intuitionistic linear logic – with the modality <span
  class="math display">\[!_r A\]</span> where <span
  class="math display">\[r \in R\]</span> and <span
  class="math display">\[(R, 0, +, 1, \times)\]</span> is a semiring.
  The modality <span class="math display">\[!A\]</span> says that <span
  class="math display">\[A\]</span> can be used as many times as we
  wish, but <span class="math display">\[!_r A\]</span> not only tells
  us that <span class="math display">\[A\]</span> can be used any number
  of times, but tells us that it has been used exactly <span
  class="math display">\[r\]</span> times. The operations of the
  semiring are then used in the inference rules to calculate each <span
  class="math display">\[r\]</span>. Here are a few examples:
  <center>
  <a href="/images/posts/2016-11-12-LL2016/graded-LL-example.jpeg"><img width="80%" src="/images/posts/2016-11-12-LL2016/graded-LL-example.jpeg"></a>
  </center>
  <p>I think this may lead to a way to add the costs on attack trees in
  my project. Check out the list of talks
  <a href="https://ll2016.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/4">here</a>.</p>
  <p>One finally point about the workshop. I was happy to see that it
  was not an all male event. There were a number of female participants
  as well as three talks by women. Hopefully, in the future we will have
  an even split, but this is better than zero.</p>
  <p>This workshop was also great for networking. This was the first
  time I met Dominic Orchard and it seems we have a lot of similar
  interest. I finally got to meet
  <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~mellies/">Paul-André Melliès</a>, and he
  even taught me some new tricks with composing comonad/monads using
  adjoints which has me very excited. I greatly admire his work, and he
  is a super nice guy! All in all, the trip to Lyon was fantastic. Check
