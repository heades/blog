I wanted to bring to everyones attention a couple of workshops that I'm helping with that will be online, and are waiting for your submission.

- [LINEARITY && TLLA 2020](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/LinearityTLLA2020/cfp.html) - I'm on the PC for this joint workshop.  I really love these two workshops. Attending these I've made lots of freinds and gotten lots of useful feedback.  Please consider submitting!

- [Graphical Models in Security (GraMSec 2020)](https://gramsec.uni.lu/) - I'm a cochair of this workhsop on the use of graph-based theory and tools used in security.  This year we have widended the scope, the entires of interest to my research community are:

  1. Graph representations: mathematical, conceptual, and implemented
     tools for describing and reasoning about security and safety

  2. Logical approaches: formal logical tools for representing and
     reasoning about graphs and their use as modelling tools in security

  7. Semantics: developing or studying semantic approaches to graph-based
     models used in security like set theoretic models, categorical models,
     logical models, etc.

  8. Threat modelling: modelling and analysing software systems security,
     models for DevSecOps, etc.

  9. Security requirements: models and tools for describing and analysing
     requirements on system security and privacy.

  11. Secure systems: safe and secure system design, quantification of
      security/safety, models for system security/safety evaluation.

  These entries have a large non-empty intersection with topics related to PL, types, and category theory.
